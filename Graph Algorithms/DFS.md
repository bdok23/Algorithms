### **Depth First Search**
*DFS* - Similar to BFS, except uses an edge based technique and is mainly for generating mazes and puzzles. 

It is recursive and uses backtracking. 

Time Complexity: **O(V+E)** - V = number of nodes, E = number of edges

Applications: Finding nodes, connected components, if a node exists,...

Implementation:
