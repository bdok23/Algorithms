### **Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**
*Spanning Tree* - Given a connected and undirected graph, the spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree that connects all the vertices
 together. 
 
*Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)* - A spanning tree with the least weight among the other spanning trees. 

An MST has V-1 edges, where the original graph has V vertices. 

MST is useful for network design, approximation for NP problems, cluster analysis, ...

*Kruskal's Algorithm* - Finds an MST.
