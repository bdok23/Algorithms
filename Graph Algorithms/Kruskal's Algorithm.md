### **Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**
*Spanning Tree* - Given a connected and undirected graph, the spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree that connects all the vertices
 together. 
 
*Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)* - A spanning tree with the least weight among the other spanning trees.
