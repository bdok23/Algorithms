### **Disjoint Set/Union Find**
*Disjoint-Set Data Structure* - Keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint subsets.

*Union Find Algorithm* - Finds which subset an element is in. Also joins two subsets together (or connected componenets). 

Applications: 
Useful for seeing if two nodes are in the same connected component. Also for Joining two connected componenets. 

Time Complexity: **O(log n)** actually it is **O(a(m))** where a(m) is the inverse ackermann function
